                <p class="content">Pizza is one of the world’s most popular foods.

                  In the U.S., 350 slices are eaten every second, while 40% of Americans eat pizza at least once a week.
                  
                  There’s a reason why pizza is so popular. Humans are drawn to foods that are fatty and sweet and rich and complex. Pizza has all of these components. Cheese is fatty, meat toppings tend to be rich, and the sauce is sweet.
                  
                  Pizza toppings are also packed with a compound called glutamate, which can be found in the tomatoes, cheese, pepperoni and sausage. When glutamate hits our tongues, it tells our brains to get excited – and to crave more of it. This compound actually causes our mouths to water in anticipation of the next bite.
                  
                  Then there are the combinations of ingredients. Cheese and tomato sauce are like a perfect marriage. On their own, they taste pretty good. But according to culinary scientists, they contain flavor compounds that taste even better when eaten together.<a href="#top">Back&nbsp;to&nbsp;Top</a></p>

The importance of the hamburger in American popular culture is indicated by its virtual ubiquity at backyard barbecues and on fast-food restaurant menus and by the proliferation of so-called hamburger stands and restaurants. Some chains, such as McDonald’s, Burger King, and Wendy’s, proliferated worldwide.<a href="#top">Back&nbsp;to&nbsp;Top</a></p>

            <p class="content">Chow mein is a bastardized form of an authentic dish called, in Mandarin, "ch'ao mien", or "stir-fried noodles". The authentic dish is prepared by frying boiled noodles w with a few bits of meat and vegetables. Those crisp noodles served in this country are not found in China. Chop suey originated in a legendary Calif. mining camp, where a legendary Chinese cook found himself shorthanded one day & gave his customers a mishmash of whatever was lying around. When asked what the dish was called he said "chop suey" (or,in Mandarin, "tsa sui"), which can be translated as "miscellaneous broken pieces. One food the Chinese do not eat is cheese.
